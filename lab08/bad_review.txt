Room 207vwas soooo tiny, it was like a prison cell and I mean tiny. 
The bed was soooo soft and creaky. 
The bathroom was so small, there was almost no room for one's legs when sitting on the loo seat. 
The bathroom door was so squeaky, it needed oiling. 
The hotel was so noisy all night, people slamming doors, loud laughter etc. 
It was one of the worst experiences regarding hotels. 
I will never ever book to stay in it or recommend it to friends. 
Sorry
