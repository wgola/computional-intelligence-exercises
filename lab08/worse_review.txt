Room 207vwas soooo tiny, it was like a prison cell and I mean very tiny. 
The bed was soooo soft and much creaky. 
The bathroom was so small, there was almost no room for one's legs when sitting on the low seat. 
The bathroom door was so squeaky, it needed oiling. 
The hotel was so noisy all night, people constantly slamming doors, very loud laughter etc. 
It was the worst experience regarding hotels in my life. 
I will never ever book to stay in it or recommend it to any of my friends.
